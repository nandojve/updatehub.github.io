So you can get to know UpdateHub in a practical way and see how simple it is to keep your devices updated in the field using a secure way of communication. We assume that you have previous experience with the Yocto Project , know the main terms and have already created an image using it. If you are new to this tutorial , you can use it. What You Will Need \u00b6 To follow this guide, you will need the following: A Raspberry Pi 3 Model B or B+ An 4 GB or larger micro SD card An Ethernet cable for wired connectivity to the internet An UpdateHub account to access the hosted server An UpdateHub account allows manager even 5 devices; for more support and features is advisable migrate your plan . Step guide \u00b6 To generate an image that connects a device to the UpdateHub Cloud , we will first have to prepare the Yocto Project environment with the basic layers to generate an image with support for UpdateHub . In addition to the layers, you will need to configure some variables that are generated on the Dashboard. The first is the product identifier to which the device and the image will be connected. Then we will have to generate an access key in Settings that will authenticate the device when it accesses the server. At this point, we check the local.conf file to verify that everything is correct and build the image . That's it! Now just burn the image on the device and it is prepared with OTA support. Additionally we update the image by adding ssh support and we send the updated image to UpdateHub Cloud and show how simple an update of your device is with the create a rollout . First step: preparing the Yocto Project environment \u00b6 The first step is to initialize the environment to build a Linux image using Yocto Project and for that, we need to fetch all the needed layers, that includes the main OE-Core layers, the BSP layer that adds support to Raspberry Pi and the layers that add support to UpdateHub . To get the platform you need to have Repo (a tool for manager git repositories) installed: For Debian/Ubuntu based distros run: sudo apt-get install repo For others distros, check the distro documentation or install repo manually: mkdir -p ~/.bin PATH=\"${HOME}/.bin:${PATH}\" curl https://storage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/.bin/repo chmod a+rx ~/.bin/repo To download the platform source, that will download all layers: mkdir updatehub-get-started cd updatehub-get-started repo init -u https://github.com/UpdateHub/updatehub-yocto-project-get-started.git -b dunfell repo sync Setup the environment with: source ./setup-environment build At the end of the commands, you have all metadata you need to start to work. Second step: creating a product \u00b6 One of the variables needed to generate the image is the product identifier that is generated when creating a Product . To create a Product just go to Dashboard and click on Add product . By doing that the following dialog will be displayed. You should choose a Product name and in Owner choose Me . About the name and owner Bear in the mind that after you create a Product you can not rename or delete it, and you can not transfer it to an organization or vice versa, so have sure you are choosing the correct name and the owner. After the Product has been created a Unique Identifier Number ( UPDATEHUB_PRODUCT_UID ) is generated to identify it. This number should be added to your build to allow the UpdateHub Agent , which runs inside the target device, to communicate with the UpdateHub Cloud . For convenience, you can add the UPDATEHUB_PRODUCT_UID to your build/conf/local.conf configuration file when prototyping. However, as this is information that will be permanent for the whole product life cycle, it should be put inside your distribution configuration file or image recipe. In case you didn't copy the Product Unique Identifier Number the moment that you create it on the UpdateHub Cloud doesn't worry. To get access to this information again you must click on the Product icon and the Unique Identifier Number will be shown to you. Once you have logged in, the Products page will display the list of your own products and the other products you have access to. Third step: generating an Access Key \u00b6 To authenticate and authorize requests for a project build with the UpdateHub Cloud you must have a security credential in the form of an application access key. Each access key is specific to your user and is used to upload the packages update or any other external integration which needs to access the UpdateHub API. To generate an Access Key you must enter the Settings menu and click on the + Request Access Key button. Choose a name for the key and select the API Key owner as Me . Once the Access Key is created a dialog will appear to show the security credentials. Save your keys On the moment that this window is closed the keys will not be shown again and if you lose them you must revoke the Access Key and generate a new one. Include these variables in build/conf/local.conf : UPDATEHUB_ACCESS_ID = \"your-email@gmail.com-8bc21121049af...\" UPDATEHUB_ACCESS_SECRET = \"9b1fcee96795fa5dea5cd04cb1d2...\" Fourth step: Configuring the local.conf file \u00b6 Come back to Yocto Project directory on your computer. After fetching the bitbake layers are important to change some variables in the local.conf file. Here we'll put the variables that were generated before: UPDATEHUB_PRODUCT_UID from the Product and the UPDATEHUB_ACCESS_ID and UPDATEHUB_ACCESS_SECRET generated in Settings . UPDATEHUB_PRODUCT_UID = \"05344b71c3e9f8...\" UPDATEHUB_ACCESS_ID = \"your-email@gmail.com-8bc21121049af...\" UPDATEHUB_ACCESS_SECRET = \"9b1fcee96795fa5dea5cd04cb1d2...\" UPDATEHUB_PACKAGE_VERSION_SUFFIX is used to add a suffix in the version of the image being generated. This is useful for placing a version number and incrementing with each new image. UPDATEHUB_PACKAGE_VERSION_SUFFIX =\"-test-image-1.0\" Finally, the final of your local.conf file should seem like this. UPDATEHUB_PRODUCT_UID = \"05344b71c3e9f8...\" UPDATEHUB_ACCESS_ID = \"your-email@gmail.com-8bc21121049af...\" UPDATEHUB_ACCESS_SECRET = \"9b1fcee96795fa5dea5cd04cb1d2...\" UPDATEHUB_PACKAGE_VERSION_SUFFIX = \"-test-image-1.0\" Fifth step: building an image \u00b6 With all variables configured, now we can generate our image. Open a terminal, go to your build directory and type: bitbake updatehub-image-base The generate image process can take a good time; it is dependent directly of the host resources. Now it's time to burn the image in the SD card. Then in a terminal go to this directory: build/tmp/deploy/images/raspberrypi3/ And type this: Check the name of the SD card before executing the command below! You can check the device name that corresponds to the SD card using the command dmesg . zcat updatehub-image-base-raspberrypi3.wic.gz | sudo dd of=/dev/sdX With the SD card ready, you can insert it into the target and connect it to RaspberryPi . The image is configured to obtain an IP address using DHCP. To access the console, the user is set to \"root\u201d and doesn't need to enter a password, just hit Enter . You can confirm the version of the image that is running on the target with the command: cat /etc/os-release You will see the version that you put in the local.conf file. O.S. Systems Embedded Linux 19.10 raspberrypi3 ttyS0 root@raspberrypi3:~# cat /etc/os-release ID=\"oel\" NAME=\"O.S. Systems Embedded Linux\" VERSION=\"19.10\" VERSION_ID=\"19.10-test-image-1.0\" PRETTY_NAME=\"O.S. Systems Embedded Linux 19.10\" UPDATEHUB_PRODUCT_UID=\"05344b71c3e9f8...\"\" root@raspberrypi3:~# Sixth step: changing the image \u00b6 Now that the whole upgrade process has been explained, we'll add support for an SSH server on the target and create an update package to install this functionality. To add support for the SSH OpenSSH server add the following line to the conf/local.conf file: IMAGE_FEATURES += \"ssh-server-openssh\" And change the variable UPDATEHUB_PACKAGE_VERSION_SUFFIX to use the version of our test image: UPDATEHUB_PACKAGE_VERSION_SUFFIX = \"-test-image-2.0\" Seventh step: sending a new image version \u00b6 We can save the file, generate a new update package, and send the new file to UpdateHub Cloud by running the same command: bitbake updatehub-image-base -c uhupush After sending, the package will be available on the Dashboard in the Package section of the corresponding Product page. Eighth step: creating a rollout \u00b6 The rollout is the process of sending an updated image to devices in the field through UpdateHub Cloud . To create a rollout we have to access the Dashboard , access the Product card we created before and then click on Create rollout . In the displayed window choose the available version and click on Save and start . The status of the update process is shown in the displayed window, and can also be followed by the Devices section for each device individually. When the status shows updated, we can access the target using the SSH protocol, for this type in the host: ssh root@TARGET_IP_ADDR No password is required, just hit Enter and we will be in the target console. Again we can check the version with the contents of the /etc/os-release file. Here we finish our quick start, but we invite you to learn more about UpdateHub in the rest of the documentation.

It handles all aspects related to sending Firmware Over-the-Air (FOTA) updates with maximum security and efficiency, making your project the center of your attention. Supported Platforms \u00b6 To maximize the diversity of projects which can benefit from UpdateHub use, we provide support for Yocto Project\u2122 and Zephyr Project\u2122 based devices, encompassing Linux and RTOS based devices. Basic Concepts \u00b6 There are a few basic concepts that are important to understand the UpdateHub . Those basic concepts are detailed below: Product: is the base that connects everything together through the UpdateHub . Essentially the Product includes one or multiple Devices , and for each of them, there is a Package version that may be updated using a Rollout . Device: it represents your physical device. It has multiple characteristics that are tracked on the management platform, as such: hardware type, unique identifier, runtime attributes, and more. Package: encompasses a software version, including the filesystem image, bootloader, or any other objects. Rollout: it is essentially a deployment plan. It can be simple as \"send version 2.0 for all devices\" or a more complex plan, selecting specific filters and enforcing a gradual deployment across the devices in the field. Rollback: this allows to roll back to the previous working version if a new version has critical errors, ensuring that the device will continue to function after the upgrade. Features \u00b6 The UpdateHub has a rich feature set. On the management platform side it offers support for: Single and team managed products 2-click rollout creation for fast deployment across all your devices Multi-step rollout support for finner control about the rollout process across your devices (e.g: lab, alpha testers, production) HTTP API to control the system remotely The support provided by the UpdateHub for the device includes: Support for multiple Yocto Project\u2122 and Zephyr Project\u2122 versions Bootloader upgrade support (U-Boot and GRUB) Flash support (NAND, NOR) UBIFS support Update package signature validation for security Automated rollback in case of update fail Conditional installation (content, version, and custom pattern support) Callback support for every update step HTTP API to control and inquiry the local agent UpdateHub Server Editions \u00b6 UpdateHub Server is available in two editions: UpdateHub Community Edition : is ideal for individual developers and small teams looking to get started with UpdateHub and experimenting with Firmware Over-the-Air (FOTA) updates. UpdateHub Cloud : is designed for enterprise development and IT teams who need an end-to-end solution to build and ship Firmware Over-the-Air (FOTA) updates with maximum security and efficiency at any scale. UpdateHub Cloud \u00b6 UpdateHub Cloud have a rich but simple interface with all the tools required to: Create and operate your own Products Access Products from organizations Check when new Packages are available for updates Oversee a fleet of Devices on the field Deploy updates via an Over-The-Air system running the Rollouts In essence the UpdateHub Cloud allows oversight over the whole UpdateHub platform and operations, making it easy to manage any need that you might have.

It runs all tasks involved in the updating execution and allows the user to set the behavior of activity flow. The UpdateHub also allows the user to check and manage his device\u2019s fleet in a unique location. Which versions are available? \u00b6 UpdateHub has two flavors: Open Source and Cloud . The tool is made of two parts: an agent (internal in devices) and a server. The UpdateHub Agent is the same in both versions, but the server on the Open Source version is hosted by the user, while UpdateHub Cloud is hosted in a dedicated, secure cloud server. The use of UpdateHub is free? \u00b6 The Open Source version is totally free forever. The Cloud version allows registering up to 5 free devices. How do I use it? \u00b6 The installing and use processes are described in detail in our tutorial Quick starting with Raspberry Pi 3 . Which operational systems supported it? \u00b6 The UpdateHub works with Yocto Project Embedded Linux and Zephyr Project -based devices. The UpdateHub can update the applications in the device? \u00b6 No. The UpdateHub deals with the updates in an atomic way, to reduce the risk of errors and simplify the Quality Assurance process which every update package usually goes through during the product development cycle. Dashboard \u00b6 Why does the Rollout process appear unfinished? \u00b6 It happens because the process continues allowing new Devices to the existing Rollout . It's also important to cover the cases where manufacturing happens without network connectivity and the adding Devices occurs later. That is the reason why UpdateHub works on, how we call, an infinite Rollout . The UpdateHub uses which connections type to update the device? \u00b6 The UpdateHub Agent in Linux uses HTTPS to connect to Cloud , or in the case of Zephyr , the connection is made through CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol). How to access my Product UID? \u00b6 The Product UID is your Product \u2019s unique identifier and is essential to UpdateHub works. It\u2019s shown when the Product was created, but also can be consulted in Dashboard , in the Product page clicking on the icon of Product . How do I know my RSA key ? \u00b6 The RSA key is available just in creation, so if you lost this, you must create a new key (and save the key in a secure local). A Rollout configured to cover all Devices will cover even the Devices connected to the platform after the Rollout created? \u00b6 Yes. That\u2019s why UpdateHub never finishes a Rollout and even if new Devices are connected it can \u201cjoin\u201d the live Rollout if the filter matches. Why does my Rollout does not reach 100%? \u00b6 It happens when Devices are not updated because of external factors as network failure, or when its next probe time has not been reached yet. What\u2019s the Fault Tolerance in the Rollout settings? \u00b6 This rate allows the Rollout process to fail on some Devices , and if the rate is exceeded the Rollout process is interrupted, keeping the devices that have successfully completed updated, but not continuing for those the Devices are still pending. Pricing \u00b6 How is UpdateHub charged? \u00b6 UpdateHub billing is metered depending on the resources used during the period. We prepared an Account Explained at the menu Pricing . Check it out! It\u2019s also possible to estimate these costs by the UpdateHub Calculator . Is it possible to get an estimate before starting to use it? \u00b6 Sure. You can estimate your monthly billing using the UpdateHub Calculator or by contacting our team directly by form contact form. How do I estimate the cost using the Calculator ? \u00b6 On Pricing , go to Estimate your costs bottom and select the number of devices that will be activated. In the left menu, firstly you\u2019ll choose how many devices you would like to update. Then, choose the update size and how many update rollouts you will do. Lastly, by selecting the percentage of devices included for each update rollout, you will get the Devices and Rollout billing estimate. The billing is different from that estimated. What happened? \u00b6 The UpdateHub Calculator considers the main fees charged on UpdateHub to generate an estimative. It doesn\u2019t mean that all fees will be covered every time or with the same value. For example, if Devices are already activated, the activation fee won't be charged. As well as the percentage of devices included in a Rollout update may be less than 100%. What Activation fee cover? Is it charged monthly? \u00b6 The activation fee will be charged only when a device is activated. But take care, if you deactivate a device and activate it after billing, so its activation fee will be charged again. But, if you disable one device and activate it in the same month, the fee will be charged just one time. I'm using UpdateHub Cloud on 5 devices, but I need to add a new one. How to upgrade my account? \u00b6 In your Dashboard , access the Billing by clicking on the account icon on the top right, and later click on Unlock unlimited usage .

In this section we show the ways to interact and setting the UpdateHub Agent through the Callbacks use and the SDK functions. Callbacks \u00b6 Callbacks are called during process flows that trigger sets of scripts and allow the user to add behavior to the UpdateHub Agent without changing the agent\u2019s code directly. Callbacks are called upon entering individual states and then execute the assigned scripts. If the user wants, it is possible to change the callback call directly in the code to the most appropriate point of execution of the scripts. There are three types of callback: State change : this callback is called on state changes and informs the current state of the machine. The Probe , Download , Install , Reboot , and Error states use it. Validate : it is called before the state machine starts, and by default, it is called when an update is installed. It allows the execution of tests that guarantee the system\u2019s functionality according to the user's needs. Rollback : is called when the Validate callback fails to validate the new firmware version successfully. In this case, the system must be reverted to the previous version, and actions might need to be taken, such as, for example, reversing the data migration made from the old system to the new one. After that, the agent reboots the device to the old installation. The callbacks are added during the Yocto Project image generating. To this, the script must be available in meta-updatehub/updatehub , together with the recipe (.bb) containing the settings necessary to install and run the script. Below we present the same script examples that quickly implement and allow agent behavior flexibility. Here we have a simple function that checks a specified address to allow it to continue the process. In the Reboot state , the callback makes the agent ask a defined server for permission to proceed and wait for a 200 status code as an answer; anything different will cancel the reboot. Energy and data use management are critical in remote devices, so turning off the unused resources is smart. A script to turn on the GSM connection, for instance, is a good idea and is simple, as shown below: The code checks the current state and, if the state is probe state, it activates the GSM connection, allowing the device checks to available updates on the server to update. Many different use cases are applied in the UpdateHub Agent through the callbacks use. Still, sometimes you want to put this logic inside the application, for instance, to use a graphic screen or use more complex logic that depends on multiple data sources, for example. Those more advanced use cases can be fulfilled using the UpdateHub SDK , in various programming languages, as described in the SDK subsection below. Software Development Kit \u00b6 The UpdateHub has an SDK that allows easy iteration with the UpdatHub Agent . There are four options of SDK: Rust , Python , Qt , and Go . All provide the very same structure and support, being different just the language used. The SDK provides the following API requests: Direct download - allows you to pass to UpdateHub Agent the link to immediate and direct download. Local install - inform the UpdateHub Agent of the address in the local storage that contains the .uhupkg . Probe request - send the control of agent to Probe state . Abort download - cancel the download process. Info - pass the information of the UpdateHub Agent to the user. Log - presents the log register. All of these are detailed in The State Machine and the Flows subsection , where we explain in detail which states can call each request. Whenever you need to interact with the UpdateHub Agent workflow inside your application, the SDK helps in reducing the hassle to do so. We provide an example, in all SDK versions, which shows how to listen to a specific state change.

In addition to that, the Updatehub Agent makes available to the user several settings that allow flexibility in the update processes of your device. To better understand better how the Updatehub Agent works in this section we will cover: The state machine and how it works through possibles of executions flows Description of the task involved in each state How callbacks work","title":"Meeting the UpdateHub Agent"},{"location":"updatehub-agent/state-machine/","text":"This session describes in detail the states in the UpdateHub Agent and the activities ran by them. However, we are tipping you to read the UpdateHub Agent flows before because this clarifies the role of each state in the agent\u2019s execution. The clarify the agente execution, we detail the flows with diagrams. We highlight the states and transitions used in each flow, while states and transitions left in gray are unused for that execution flow. The state machine of the UpdateHub Agent has two state's type. Those are: Preemptive states : they can handle the external requests from the API. Non-preemptive states : when they receive the external request, they respond that the agent is busy and keep the original flow running uninterrupted. The states below are part of the default flow, and external API requests can also trigger some. For more details about the UpdateHub Agent flow, see here. entry point - is the starting point of the state machine. It goes to the Poll state if the automatic probing support is enabled or to the Park state if there is nothing to do. park - the agent stays in this state if the automatic probing support is disabled until it receives external requests. poll - the Poll state moves the state machine to the Probe state , informing if it must process it immediately or wait for the required probe interval to the next probe request. probe - the Probe state checks for an update package in the server, and when there is one available, collects the required metadata to move to the Validation state . In case there is no update available, the machine moves to the Entry Point state . validation - the metadata authenticity and correctness validations must pass so the update packages requirements can be validated before download any update package data. download - all update package objects are downloaded, reusing previously downloaded objects if possible. install - every update package object is installed accordingly to its specific mode of it. The last action is to swap the activated installation set, making the just installed update ready to be used. reboot - restarts the device. error - in case of a mistake, the state machine is moved to the Error state . It registers the log of the process and cleanups and moves the state machine back to the Entry point state . The API can trigger requests to two specific states: Prepare local install state and the Direct download state . Those are described below: direct download - the Direct download state fetches the remote update package (uhupkg) from a custom server and make it available for the Prepare local install state . prepare local install - the uncompression, validation, and correctness checks must pass before moving the state machine to the Install state to proceed with the installation of it. The UpdateHub Agent uses a well-defined state machine, and the description of this machine is the best way to understand the update\u2019s process and how to interact with the agent\u2019s default flow. Here we present the steps performed in the state machine and the summary of executed activities for each of them. An essential aspect of the state machine in use is that every activity is recycled between the states, adding more efficiency. The flow of the Direct Download request and the Local Install request as interesting to explore this as the activities are practically the same. The unique difference is that in the Direct Download request , the agents download the external update\u2019s data, while in the Local Install request , the update\u2019s data is in the local storage. The other activities are the same between the requests. Default behavior \u00b6 The UpdateHub Agent has two operation modes: it can automatically search for new updates on a pre-setted interval. It can also work in an idle mode where searching or installing an update is only triggered by an external interaction. These two different workflows are triggered by the configuration file that the agent reads upon starting. The other workflows are triggered by requests from an external HTTP API that the agent will be listening to, coming from the CLI application, or another program that wants to interact with the UpdateHub Agent . Automatic search \u00b6 The primary usage of the Updatehub Agent is to check for updates in the UpdateHub Cloud server automatically. In this workflow, the agent can work without any interaction from the external API. When the UpdateHub Agent is started, it goes to the Entry point state . This state verifies the settings of the machine for the next transition state. The next stage is the Poll state , where the agent calculates how much time it should wait until checking with the server if there\u2019s an update available. The machine then goes to the Probe state and awaits the appropriate time before checking for new updates on the server. When it is time to access the server to check for an update, the Probe state is activated, and it accesses the UpdateHub Cloud and searches for some new update\u2019s data. If no update is available, the machine goes back to the Entry point state . When an update is available on the server, the Validation state is activated and checks the authenticity of the update\u2019s data. The Validation state also verifies whether the device has the necessary storage space for the update process. Following that, the Download state then downloads all the required data, checking the integrity of the packages, and the Install state installs the data on the proper partition of the device\u2019s storage. By the end of the installation, the device is rebooted. After rebooting, the agent begins at the Entry point state again and restarts a new cycle. In case of an error in Probe , Valitation , Download , Install , or Reboot , the Error state is triggered. The Error state allows the user to use the callback to handle situations. For more information about it, see in the Callback session. No automatic search \u00b6 When the automatic search is disabled, the UpdateHub Agent behaves passively, relying on external requests to inquire for new updates. This mode is useful when the user wants to control the exact time of updates according to his needs and spend fewer device resources, such as energy. When a new request comes, the machine's control changes from the Park state to the requested state and the remainder of the process is the same as the normal state execution. The way to communicate to the Updatehub Agent is through the external HTTP API. The API offers a set of requests for the user to interact with the agent\u2019s flow. We now show the execution flows for these requests. API requests \u00b6 The API has a set of calls that allows the user to interact with the UpdateHub Agent , and here we\u2019ll present them. Regarding the update process, there are the Direct download request and the Local install request . Besides them, the Probe request that when the control is in a preemptive state, give it back to the Probe state . We follow the Abort download request that aborts any download\u2019s process, default, or direct. And lastly, we will show two requests that provide information about the state machine, the Info request and the Log request . Direct download request \u00b6 In this process, the agent receives the Direct download request . The server of search is defined using a link to an alternative server or other location where the uhupkg (update package compatible with the UpdateHub Agent ) is available. Subsequently, the Prepare local install state performs the necessary tasks of space and resources validation, such as storage. With the completion of these activities, the Install state is executed, installing the essential data and deallocating resources that are no longer needed for the process. Finally, the device is restarted with the new image running the Reboot state . Set the URL to the desired location: { \"url\": \"https://some_remote_url.domain/update.uhupkg\" } So, to activate the Direct download request use the command: http://updatehub_agent:port/remote_install Local install request \u00b6 When the UpdateHub Agent receives the Local install request , the update package should already be available on local storage on the device. This can be done with a pen-drive, for example, and requires direct user interference on the device. So, the Prepare local install state verifies the authentication, data integrity and the space available on the device\u2019s storage. It reserves the necessary resources for installation and calls the Install state to proceed with the installation. The device is then rebooted into the newly installed image. The path of the uhupkg file is required, as shown below: { \"file\": \"/tmp/updatehub-image-qa-uh-qemu-x86-64.uhupkg\" } Later, just type: http://updatehub_agent:port/local_install Probe request \u00b6 The Probe request can be accepted during any preemptive state and it returns the control to the Probe state . The purpose of interrupt the flow and sending the state machine control from preemptive state to Probe state is that it is possible to start the update process, without waiting for the time for a new automatic search, or for looking for a new update when the automatic polling is disabled. The Probe request can be invoked in two ways: the default, in which the search for update packages is done on the default server specified by the settings file, and custom way, specifying a different UpdateHub server to use during this update cycle. After executing the update process, or verifying that it does not have an update available, the machine returns to the entry point and proceeds to the configured flow.

It can also work in an idle mode where searching or installing an update is only triggered by an external interaction. These two different workflows are triggered by the configuration file that the agent reads upon starting. The other workflows are triggered by requests from an external HTTP API that the agent will be listening to, coming from the CLI application, or another program that wants to interact with the UpdateHub Agent .","title":"Default behavior"},{"location":"updatehub-agent/state-machine/#automatic-search","text":"The primary usage of the Updatehub Agent is to check for updates in the UpdateHub Cloud server automatically. In this workflow, the agent can work without any interaction from the external API. When the UpdateHub Agent is started, it goes to the Entry point state . This state verifies the settings of the machine for the next transition state. The next stage is the Poll state , where the agent calculates how much time it should wait until checking with the server if there\u2019s an update available. The machine then goes to the Probe state and awaits the appropriate time before checking for new updates on the server. When it is time to access the server to check for an update, the Probe state is activated, and it accesses the UpdateHub Cloud and searches for some new update\u2019s data. If no update is available, the machine goes back to the Entry point state . When an update is available on the server, the Validation state is activated and checks the authenticity of the update\u2019s data. The Validation state also verifies whether the device has the necessary storage space for the update process. Following that, the Download state then downloads all the required data, checking the integrity of the packages, and the Install state installs the data on the proper partition of the device\u2019s storage. By the end of the installation, the device is rebooted. After rebooting, the agent begins at the Entry point state again and restarts a new cycle. In case of an error in Probe , Valitation , Download , Install , or Reboot , the Error state is triggered. The Error state allows the user to use the callback to handle situations. For more information about it, see in the Callback session.","title":"Automatic search"},{"location":"updatehub-agent/state-machine/#no-automatic-search","text":"When the automatic search is disabled, the UpdateHub Agent behaves passively, relying on external requests to inquire for new updates.

In summary, we can say that a Rollout is the process of applying a Package to certain Devices but in subsections below more detailed description is given. Manipulating a Package \u00b6 A Package is an update that will add or remove information to an image that is running on a Device that is in the field. First, a modified image will be sent to the server with a specific command (see more in uhupkg), and then it is available in the Package subsection, becoming available to be selected in a new Rollout. In Dashboard , the Package is available after you join in a specific Product . In this session we will cover: Viewing the Package list More informations about a Package Viewing the Package list \u00b6 The Packages page, in the same fashion, as the Devices page, exhibit a list with information about the Packages inside a specific Product the user selected, such as: Package Unique Identifier (UID) Version Supported hardware list Status Size Upload date Each one of these items helps the user find a specific Package . To filter more efficiently the Packages you can select and associate them with the following items during the search: Status of each Packages can be found depending on the situation for the Rollout Available : the Packages is ready to be downloaded Upload in Progress : Packages during the uploaded process Removed : Packages that were removed from the Packages list Pending Progress : Packages being checked by the server Packages with Error : Packages that failed the system checksum Version for the Package Supported hardware More information about a Package \u00b6 On the Package Details page the user may have a deeper look into a particular Package and its information. Beyond the information already present on the Package List , you will find more data about the Objects and their details which are used by the UpdateHub agent during the object's installation. Once you entered the Package Details you have the option to remove the Package from the Rollout if necessary by clicking on the trash can icon. The Package will be visible and accessible but won't be available anymore. Administering a Rollout \u00b6 Rollout is the process of sending updates from the server to the Devices registered in a certain Product . To start a Rollout , the update Package must be sent to the server and then the process can be initiated by Product overview or by the subsection Rollout . In this session we will cover: Ways to create a Rollout All Devices Select the target Devices Register of Rollout Detailing a Rollout Ways to create a Rollout \u00b6 There are two methods to execute the Rollout : the simpler way is to update all the versions of the Devices present on the field at once. The other way is to select which Devices receive the update through the Advanced Mode option. All Devices \u00b6 To update all Devices in the field to the same version you just need to go to the Overview or Rollouts page and click on Create Rollout . A box to choose the version will appear. After you make this choice just click on Save to initiate the Rollout later or Save and Start launch it straight away. Select the target Devices \u00b6 The other way is to select which equipment receives the Rollout is using the Advanced Mode option that allows the use of selection filters for Devices . In Advanced Mode , you can create and name tasks that define the filters that will be applied, selecting which Devices will receive the update. In addition to the available filters, UpdateHub provides Fault Tolerance , which is a percentage that can be set by the user to abort the Rollout automatically if the failure rate exceeds the specified limit. It is advised to use Fault Tolerance percentage because this is the safety measure. The Devices can be filtered by their Version, Hardware, Devices Identifier (e.g: the MAC address), and Devices Attributes (e.g: kernel version, device total memory). Finally, Save the Rollout to start later or Save and Start it immediately. Register of Rollouts \u00b6 The Rollout List exhibits every Rollout available for the Product chosen and brief information about them, such as name, version, creation, status, and progress.

About the name and owner Pay attention that after you create a Product you can not rename or delete it, and you can not transfer it to an organization or vice versa, so be sure you are choosing the correct name and the owner. After the Product has been created a Unique Identifier Number ( UPDATEHUB_PRODUCT_UID ) is generated to identify it. This number should be added to your build to allow the UpdateHub Agent , which runs inside the target Device , to communicate with the UpdateHub Cloud . For convenience, you can add the UPDATEHUB_PRODUCT_UID to your build/conf/local.conf configuration file when prototyping.

This is usually used in auto builders as they may require different credentials depending on the product being build. UPDATEHUB_ACTIVE_INACTIVE_BACKEND \u00b6 The active and inactive image schema requires a backend to identify and choose the image to be used for next boot. It supports: u-boot , grub or grub-efi . UPDATEHUB_CUSTOM_CA_CERTS \u00b6 Specify the CA certificate bundle to be used for uhupush task. It is currently used by UpdateHub staging server for tests but may be interesting for other users when doing custom server deployments. UPDATEHUB_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTE \u00b6 This allows more details to be added on a device. This is a very useful variable to applying filters to certain devices. Some examples of attributes: kernel , cpu-model , mem-total and ipinfo-io . UPDATEHUB_DEVICE_IDENTITY \u00b6 This variable provides the device with an identity, making it easier to recognize each device during operations on UpdateHub Cloud . The supported values \u200b\u200bare: primary-iface : is the MAC of the primary network interface. cpuinfo-serial : It is the serial number of the processor, can be obtained with the command \"grep Serial / proc / cpuinfo\". custom : parameter that you can create. To create a customized parameter, simply put UPDATEHUB_DEVICE_IDENTITY + _ (underscore) + name such as UPDATEHUB_DEVICE_IDENTITY_updatehub-imx or UPDATEHUB_DEVICE_IDENTITY_updatehub-rpi. UPDATEHUB_FILESYSTEM_SUPPORT \u00b6 When using the copy or tarball installation mode, some filesystem support packages are required. This variable controls which filesystems should be supported. It supports different values, as btrfs , ext2 , ext3 , ext4 , f2fs , jffs2 , ubifs , vfat and xfs . UPDATEHUB_IMAGE_TYPE \u00b6 The updatehub can operate using different setup which can be chosen using the UPDATEHUB_IMAGE_TYPE variable. It supports different values, as below: initramfs - Enables the Updatehub gold firmware support; this adds an initramfs based image which is used for the upgrade process. In this mode, the Updatehub Agent is ran inside an initramfs image which allows for the image to be changed without the need of a spare storage space. active/inactive - Allow the use of active and inactive images schema. This reduces the downtime of the system as the image can be change without rebooting. The new image is installed in a spare storage area and in next reboot the new image is used. The UPDATEHUB_ACTIVE_INACTIVE_BACKEND variable need to set depending of the machine requirement. UPDATEHUB_INSTALL_MODE \u00b6 There are multiple installation modes supported. This is usually machine dependent as it depends on the storate type in use. Supported values are: copy , flash , raw , tarball , ubifs and imxkobs . UPDATEHUB_PACKAGE_VERSION \u00b6 Informs the system version and is based on the Yocto Project's DISTRO_VERSION variable (the version of the distribution). UPDATEHUB_PACKAGE_VERSION_SUFFIX \u00b6 It allows adding more information at the end of the variable name. UPDATEHUB_PRODUCT_UID \u00b6 The UPDATEHUB_PRODUCT_UID identifies the product id in use. This is used by the Updatehub server to identify the product and track the possible versions for Rollouts. UPDATEHUB_RUNTIME_PACKAGES \u00b6 Is a variable configured to install some package in an image that supports UpdateHub , such as an boot configuration package or to install a bootscript. UPDATEHUB_SERVER_URL \u00b6 Specifies the Updatehub server address to use. This is required in case you are running it inside your private cloud. UPDATEHUB_UHUPKG_PRIVATE_KEY \u00b6 The variable are required to point to the private key which are used to validate and sign the update package. The private key works together with the public key that is described below in UPDATEHUB_UHUPKG_PUBLIC_KEY, variable that points to the private key. The keys may or not be stored on the layer. Commonly the keys are not available for developers and passed to the build system using the local.conf file of the autobuilder. UPDATEHUB_UHUPKG_PUBLIC_KEY \u00b6 The variable to point to public key that work in conjunction with the private key to ensure more security in authentication.

Each step provides a brief description of the process that must be performed and a link to a section with more detailed information about this process. Before you start, we ask you to check if your board is supported by UpdateHub . If your board still does not have support or you encounter difficulties we will be happy to assist you through our Gitter or contact us at contact@updatehub.io First step: adding layer \u00b6 Create project from scratch \u00b6 For the creation of a project that already has the necessary layers to support UpdateHub we recommend using the platform that will download and add the necessary layers automatically, allowing you to start your implementation quickly. Integrating onto a existing project \u00b6 In a finished or under development project, the way to integrate UpdateHub is done by adding layers directly . Second step: creating a product \u00b6 Create a Product is necessary for some variables such as the product identifier to be generated. These variables must be included in the image that will be generated so that the device has the necessary data to be authorized on the UpdateHub server when accessing it. To create a product you need to be logged into your UpdateHub Cloud account . Third step: requesting an Access Key \u00b6 Access key is a variable that Updatehub uses to guarantee the authenticity of a device when it requests access to the server. Generating an Access Key is easy and after just putting it in a project's settings before the image that will be loaded on the devices is generated. Just like creating a product, creating a access key takes place within the Dashboard Fourth step: configuring the variables \u00b6 Here we show how to setting up the UpdateHub variables necessary for the correct functioning of UpdateHub . Definitions of variables as well as other variables can be found in the Glossary of variables . Fifth step: in your board \u00b6 After adding the necessary layers and configuring the variables now just generate the image with the bitbake command, save the image on the target devices and that's it! Sixth step: sending a package to server \u00b6 When changes occur in the original image that is present in devices in the field, it is necessary to update these devices by sending the package with the changed image to the UpdateHub server for it to be applied.

Every six months, a new version of Yocto Project is released. The current version is the Yocto Project 3.0, codename Zeus , and its support is provided by the meta-updatehub layer. This layer provides all the infrastructure code to enable the use of Yocto Project together with the UpdateHub . The minimal set of layers to use the UpdateHub are: Layer name Branch name poky zeus meta-openembedded/meta-oe zeus meta-openembedded/meta-python zeus meta-updatehub zeus Besides the basic support, there are many boards with UpdateHub support, provided by extra BSP integration layers, as shown at the table below: Board full name BSP layer name Machine name Branch name BeagleBone Black meta-updatehub-ti beaglebone zeus Raspberry Pi 3 meta-updatehub-raspberrypi raspberrypi3 zeus NXP i.MX6QP/Q/DL SABRE Smart Device meta-updatehub-freescale imx6qdlsabresd zeus Boundary Devices Nitrogen6X meta-updatehub-freescale nitrogen6x zeus Boundary Devices i.MX6 SABRELite meta-updatehub-freescale nitrogen6x zeus TechNexion i.MX7 PICO meta-updatehub-freescale imx7d-pico zeus Toradex Apalis iMX6Q/D meta-updatehub-freescale apalis-imx6 zeus WaRP7 meta-updatehub-freescale imx7s-warp zeus Wandboard i.MX6 QuadPlus/Quad/Dual/Solo meta-updatehub-freescale wandboard zeus If you need to use an earlier Yocto Project version, the UpdateHub is also supported. Currently, there is support for following previous Yocto Project versions: Yocto Project 2.1, codename Krogoth Yocto Project 2.2, codename Morty Yocto Project 2.3, codename Pyro Yocto Project 2.4, codename Rocko Yocto Project 2.5, codename Sumo Yocto Project 2.6, codename Thud Yocto Project 2.7, codename Warrior Yocto Project 3.0, codename Zeus These earlier versions are actively supported by the UpdateHub , but features and compatible machines may vary among them. Adding layer to your project \u00b6 The first step is initialize the environment to build a Linux image using Yocto Project . To start working with Yocto Project we need to fetch all the needed layers, that includes the poky , meta-openembedded , meta-raspberrypi , meta-updatehub and meta-updatehub-raspberrypi layers. The meta-updatehub is the layer that adds support to UpdateHub itself, and meta-updatehub-raspberrypi includes UpdateHub support for Raspberry Pi machines. In addition, we need to get the meta-openembedded layer, because UpdateHub has some dependencies, such as Python 3 packages to create the uhu utility used as UpdateHub package manager and will be covered in this guide. Here we will show you two different approaches to download the necessary layers to support UpdateHub : one using a platform which will download the necessary layers and add them automatically to the project, the other approach is to manually download and add these layers. Using UpdateHub Platform \u00b6 To get a platform you need have Repo installed. Repo is a tool that helps manage many Git repositories, uploading to revision control systems and automating parts of the development workflow. Install the repo utility: mkdir ~/bin curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo chmod a+x ~/bin/repo Download the platform source: PATH=${PATH}:~/bin mkdir updatehub-platform cd updatehub-platform repo init -u https://github.com/UpdateHub/updatehub-yocto-project-reference-platform.git -b zeus repo sync Setup the environment: source ./setup-environment build At the end of the commands you have every metadata you need to start working. Adding the layers manually \u00b6 To include the Updatehub Yocto layers in your build is easy just clone the meta-updatehub layer and the machine support layer to your sources directory following the commands below: git clone https://github.com/openembedded/meta-openembedded -b zeus git clone https://github.com/UpdateHub/meta-updatehub -b zeus In /build folder of your project include: bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-openembedded/meta-oe bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-openembedded/meta-python bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-openembedded/meta-networking bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-updatehub For Raspberry Pi 3, you can do that using: git clone https://github.com/UpdateHub/meta-updatehub-raspberrypi In /build folder of your project include: bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-updatehub-raspberrypi/ For BeagleBone Black , you can use: git clone https://github.com/UpdateHub/meta-updatehub-ti In /build folder of your project include: bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-updatehub-ti/ And for imx6qdlsabresd , use: git clone https://github.com/UpdateHub/meta-updatehub-freescale In /build folder of your project include: bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-updatehub-freescale/ Done! Now you have the UpdateHub layer in your project. Configurating UpdateHub variables \u00b6 You should now to include UpdateHub system variables in conf/local.conf . The variables below are the basics for the correct configuration. More details and options see Glossary of variables . UPDATEHUB_PRODUCT_UID - identifies the product id in use and this is used by rollouts. It is generate in create process ends or you get this code in UpdateHub Dashboard, in Product page. UPDATEHUB_ACCESS_ID and UPDATEHUB_ACCESS_SECRET - They can be generate in Settings available in right top of screen and are necessary for server connection. UPDATEHUB_PACKAGE_VERSION_SUFFIX - added optionally, is advised for version organization. Finally the final of your local.conf file should seem like this. UPDATEHUB_PRODUCT_UID = \"05344b71c3e9f8...\" UPDATEHUB_ACCESS_ID = \"your-email@gmail.com-8bc21121049af...\" UPDATEHUB_ACCESS_SECRET = \"9b1fcee96795fa5dea5cd04cb1d2...\" UPDATEHUB_PACKAGE_VERSION_SUFFIX = \"-test-image-1.0\" Cases of adding layers manually \u00b6 If you have used the platform, the process below is not necessary, because the platform already has updatehub-image class configured. In case you are not using the platform, in addition to the variable configuration specified above, you will need to add update-image class of UpdateHub in your project recipe for to use the setting available. For this you must include \"inherit updatehub-image\" in myproject/../my-image.bb or just to add \"updatehub-image\" in inherit if this exists. The your new image with UpdateHub support layer is ready. RSA Key \u00b6 RSA keys are asymmetric encryption keys that serve to provide greater security in communications. The UpdateHub verifies the authenticity of every Package update prior applying it. To do so, it uses a RSA key that to check if the Package has not been modified or corrupted by any means. Each device will contain the public key, public_key.pem , included on the device image, which will validate any received Package before unpacking, which must have been signed with the private key, private_key.pem , when generating the update package. Although these keys are not mandatory on UpdateHub, we advise their use as an additional data protection mechanism. In this session we will cover: Generating a RSA Key Setting up RSA Key Generating a RSA Key \u00b6 The generation of the RSA keys requires the openssl utility. The private RSA key is generated using the command below: mkdir -p ~/updatehub-keys openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out ~/updatehub-keys/private_key.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:4096 Next we need to extract the public RSA key from the private key. Use the following command: openssl rsa -pubout -in ~/updatehub-keys/private_key.pem -out ~/updatehub-keys/public_key.pem Setting up RSA Key \u00b6 The keys need to be enabled inside your Yocto Project build configuration, so UpdateHub can deploy the public key inside the generated image and use the private key to sign the update package. You must set the UPDATEHUB_UHUPKG_PRIVATE_KEY and UPDATEHUB_UHUPKG_PRIVATE_KEY variables inside your conf/local.conf file as seen next: UPDATEHUB_UHUPKG_PRIVATE_KEY = \"~/updatehub-keys/private_key.pem\" UPDATEHUB_UHUPKG_PUBLIC_KEY = \"~/updatehub-keys/public_key.pem\" Keep save your RSA keys Once a device is deployed using a RSA key, the same key is used to validate every update package send to this device. It is important to keep the RSA keys safe or you'll not be able to send updates for those devices. Pushing an update package \u00b6 The UpdateHub works with upkg format for update package, and this is generated by the uhu . Update Utilities or uhu is an interactive prompt and a command line utility to manage update packages for UpdateHub agent and will provide you few new BitBake tasks, like this: uhupush : sends the update package to the UpdateHub Cloud. The generation of an update package is very simple. After the integration of the UpdateHub with your Yocto Project build is complete, the Bitbake tool can be used to generate and upload the update package. The following command does all the needed work in order to push the packages to the UpdateHub Cloud: bitbake <image> -c uhupush After running this, the UpdateHub Cloud will display that there is a new Package to update the Devices and you may start a Rollout through the interface.
